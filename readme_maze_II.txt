   The maze prints "LOVESOPHIA". It has a lot of vertices, and goes 
    the wrong way only once.

    I was creating my dfs() to return a Vertex rather than an ArrayList<Vertex>.
    A TA told me to do this, saying he believed this to be a much more elegant 
    and sensical solution. But then another TA told me I wasn't allowed, so 
    I had to redo the function.

    This wasn't my favorite assignment because I felt like the
    tools for it were so new and unfamiliar (ArrayLists, Vertexes, etc.)
    so I felt dumb and sort of crippled. But all's well that ends well,
    right? :)
